The objective of the preworkshop toolkit is to set course expectations and provide an introduction to the use of R statistical software.  This workshop will not be an R introduction, although the course content will depend exclusivley on a software package developed for R.  Accordingly, we expect basic proficiency using R prior to attending this workshop.  We also expect that all attendees will bring a computer to the workshop with R installed (v3.0.0 or later).  Those attending via webinar should also have the software installed.  We strongly encourage that RStudio be installed, although this is not a requirement.  Using R without RStudio is like driving a car without a steering wheel (an exaggeration but you get the point).  Finally, please install the SWMPr package prior to the workshop.  This package contains most of the functions that we will be describing in the workshop.  These functions are designed specifically for the SWMP data and they will make your life easier!

Below is a summary of the content and what we expect prior to the workshop.  We strongly encourage that you contact the instructors with questions or issues using these materials.  Specifically, please let us know if you there any issues installing and using the software.
